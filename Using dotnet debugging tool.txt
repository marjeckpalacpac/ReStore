NOTE: launch.json is removed in .net 8. Below is old instruction for launch.json

In order to run debugger, there are two modes.
	Inside the "launch.json" there two configurations
	1. Which is when application launch, it's going to run the application and attach a debugger to the running process
	2. Which allows to attach a debugger to an already existing process
